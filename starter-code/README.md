#Lab 1-mobile-first

**Author**: Katlyn Tucker and Liz Petersen

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
The problem domain is to create a blog app that is mobile responsive and adapts also to larger screen sizes (i.e. desktop).


## Getting Started
To build this app on their home computer, a user must first understand mobile responsive design. They would need to read the documentation that accompanies this app and build from the CSS up (based on SMACSS principles).

## Architecture
The app is designed primarily for use on mobile devices, and adaptable for other screen and viewport sizes. This is achieved through the meta tag named "viewport".
Libraries incorporated are normalize.css and icomoon.io icon library.
Languages currently include HTML, CSS, and in the future will incorporate the Javascript library, JQuery (for toggle functionality).
